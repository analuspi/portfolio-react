                <p>I'm a self-learning developer, who started coding as a R-Ladie (I did part of my PhD with R statistical language).</p>
                <p>Currently, I'm seeking to leverage my expertise to learn and grow in the role of fullstack developer. </p>
                <p> This transition is mostly inspired by an open source project that I worked as collaborator (with Node.js and React.js).</p>
                <p>I'm proactive and I have large experience in oral presentations, mentoring and teaching in three idioms (english, french and portuguese).</p>
